# 🧠 Data Structures in Python – Practice Assignment

This repository contains a Python-based assignment consisting of 35 coding problems, designed to reinforce core concepts of data structures using Python. The problems involve real-world data operations on strings, lists, sets, tuples, and dictionaries.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- ✅ String manipulation
- ✅ List operations and comprehensions
- ✅ Set theory operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)
- ✅ Tuple handling and slicing
- ✅ Dictionary operations (including nested structures)
- ✅ Custom implementations (reverse, sort, merge, count, shuffle)
- ✅ User input handling

## 🖥 Sample Code Snippets

```python
# Count vowels in a string
def is_vowel(s):
    return sum(1 for ch in s if ch.lower() in "aeiou")

# Reverse a list
my_list[::-1]

# Check for palindrome
s == s[::-1]

# Find union of sets
set1.union(set2)
```
## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-python-assignment.git
2. Open the notebook file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell to test the outputs.
